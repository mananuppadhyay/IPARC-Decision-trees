# IPARC-Decision-trees

The IPARC Challenge consists of tasks that can be decoupled to be understood as a series of changes in the images colour, structure and size. Ideas from Mathematical Morphology are such as dilation and erosion aid in describing structural changes between input and output images.The structural changes can be decomposed as the application of morphological changes with structural elements. Central to the question of intelligence and reasoning is that of pattern recognition and formation of associations, hence an approach to getting a machine to solve this problem is to teach it the aforementioned skills. 

Hence, this project to find out whether a decision tree model can be trained to identify the structural changes an image has undergone by observing variations induced in itself and its neighbouring pixels relative to its position in the image.
The goal is to investigate whether or not structural learning can occur by noticing changes in the surroundings and finding patterns in the same and how significant of a component this is in detecting changes.
